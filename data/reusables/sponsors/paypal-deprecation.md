{% note %}

**Note**: Starting on **February 23rd, 2023**, {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} will no longer support PayPal as a payment processor. Sponsors that currently use PayPal will be required to update their payment method to pay by credit or debit card.

If your sponsorship is still using PayPal as a payment method, it will be cancelled on your next billing date. For example: if you have a recurring sponsorship and paid on February 22nd using PayPal, your sponsorship will be cancelled on your next billing date on March 22nd.

For more information about updating your payment method, see "[Adding or editing a payment method](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings/adding-or-editing-a-payment-method)."
