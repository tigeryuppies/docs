{% tip %}

**Note:** Locking a repository prevents all write access to the repository. You cannot associate new teams or collaborators with a locked repository.

If you're performing a trial run, you do not need to lock the repository. When you migrate data from a repository that's in use, {% data variables.product.company_short %} strongly recommends locking the repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/migrating-data-to-and-from-your-enterprise/about-migrations#types-of-migrations)."
